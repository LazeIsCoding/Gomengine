First you have to prepare a buffer
Most likely given to OpenGL with glBufferData()

After initializing buffers, request of geometric primitives be rendered by
glDrawArrays()

Drawing := Transferring vertex data to OpenGL Server
Vertex:= Bundle of data values being processed together
Mostly positional data
Other data: Color determination

Vertex Shading:
Vertex Shader for each drawing command
Sometimes pass-through shader
Passing to a complex Shader with transformation matrices
Lighting computations for vertex color

Tessellation Shading:
patchs to describe shape
...



OpenGL Initialization

glGenVertexArrays() -> Allocate some number of vertex array object names
